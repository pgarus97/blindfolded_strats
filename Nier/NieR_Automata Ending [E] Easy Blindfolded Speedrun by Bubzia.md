Very important: pressing R3 during a hacking minigame will buffer the
camchange all the way till afterwards\! If you use the stick in hacking,
do NOT press it accidently

Important\! : dont lock your keyboard movement with RB fire while
hacking\!

Hacking with 9S move with keyboard and hit cores with controller
triangle for input cutout

9S fighting is basically just mashing counters and trying to get some
DGs or at least aerial LA spam for getting closer, also lot of PJs for
covering distance

Every QSLOAD takes around 35 seconds (english text) from menu opening to
first jump input

Dashes are not 100% normalized, try to always go for full dash into
first steps into dash again

RDs are normalized, only issue is the angle from the turnaround and
distance you move yourself

Quests accept dialogues mash only x without circle to not skip the
option

“B Fighting in general: always lockon RB,LB when available, and dash
attacks with WS1 or WS2 for homing SS or DG, after desert DDG always

checking for walls with pod fire? Only walls in front of you with camera

Transporting does NOT save automatically\!

PJs also auto target near enemies, watch out\! (Near tower)

Transport: current location is not displayed on transporter, so choosing
destination varies from save to save

Death abuse only destroys all EQUIPPED chips in the equipped CS\! -\>
early resilience

Save before every single transport

DONT FORGET TO SAVE BEFORE CORE 2 SD \!\!\!\!\!\!

Dont skip cutscenes at KoRoshi, game is very likely to crash
