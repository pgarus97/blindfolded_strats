# Notes

\- Select mash nearly all the time for cutscene skips

\- do not need to do RCs in cutscenes, mostly just mash skip

\- Fights (normal) in general: lockon and just B mash till RAGE, jump a
few times with hold B( after full B combos)in berserk mode use Y jump Y
more, RT mash all the time for RAGE, if you get hit : A hold B to
recover; Just B is fastest way to build up RAGE, cancel out last B hit
of combo with hold B, cancel Y animation with jump into hold B or just
Bs , mash Y all the time for some RCs are good too,- started 06062018
