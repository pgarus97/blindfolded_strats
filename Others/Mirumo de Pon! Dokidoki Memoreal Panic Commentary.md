1.  > Beginning: long cutscene /talk sequence for around 5:30min. The
    > game is a movie adventure game released only in Japan for GBA in
    > 2005. In this story, a fairy named warumo dan abuses an item
    > called memory beads to make people and fairies feel strange. So
    > Mirumo and his friends go to help the affected people.

2.  > Anime from 2002, ended in 2006 with 172 episodes

3.  > A to check/talk , B to dash cancel, move with dpad, switch map
    > with L/R, menu with start

4.  > Story: world of fairies and humans bargain sale from kumomo, Warmo
    > Dan evil guys,

5.  > They call to complain that they ordered a different item than
    > received

6.  > Again a wrong product = memory beads, warmo dan plots something

7.  > Yashichi comes and acts as an experiment, they use the memory
    > beads to make him hazy/ feel bad

8.  > They want to use it to defeat mirumo, yashichis friends go to
    > mirumo to ask for help

9.  > They go together to the shop, and explains the item memory beads,
    > absorbs memories and instills emotion

10. > There is a rescue method, fairy bangle\! Mirumo receives it and
    > they heal yashichi. We get his memory beads and thats the goal in
    > the game, to talk to different characters and check their memories

11. > From now on we will use it. We are told that something is wrong
    > with peta and bike, we first go to bike. First blindfolded
    > movement of the run

12. > We talk to bike. Heal, next is peter. movement , you need to
    > normalize on the walls etc. There is actually multiple routes in
    > this game and a big part of the run is the routing of an optimal
    > route.

13. > We are told that warmo dan went to the human world. So we follow
    > them. We first talk to kaede. We get a little snack

14. > Warmodan was seen at azumis room on the way back from shopping, so
    > we go there\!

15. > At the same time, warmodan at azumis, but azumi is not home
    > apparently. Hanzo and Sasuke,( two little characters want to stop
    > them), but the warmo dan uses the memory beads on them before they
    > can escape

16. > Both get very sad and angry because of the memory bads and start
    > rampaging. Now we go to azumis room and find hanzo, of course we
    > help him out here. Another big part of this run is skipping
    > cutscenes in a fast way as soon as they start.

17. > Next up we have to rescue Sasuke. Azumi enters the room and is
    > upset about yashichi because he was apparently supposed to clean
    > her room.

18. > That develops into our first minigame. There are multiple ones in
    > this run and make for most of the challenge. Either clean all the
    > board or get 20 points, but blindfolded you cannot see where you
    > cleaned already so its kind of random, you try to just can the
    > room as much as possible to reach the points and wait for the
    > timer to run out. As a reward azumi tells us of the location of
    > warmo dan = park.

19. > We go there and find Sasuke + warmo dan. Yashichi accidently tells
    > them how he got reverted back with the fairy bagel.

20. > Next minigame\! Align the pictures (slot machine) For blindfolded,
    > we try to estimate the speed of the wheels and press always
    > according to a setup that depends on the first press. We again
    > need to get 20 points which equals 2 hits.

21. > Warumo dan escapes to the school because they lost and we can
    > finally heal sasuke

22. > We head back to kaede to report and head to the next destination,
    > we can now go to the school zone. Here another route change
    > occurs, there are 4 new characters : wakaba, tomon chie and the
    > story changes dependent on who we walk to.

23. > We select wakaba as he has short walking distance and is
    > convenient for the blindfodled route.

24. > As a part of wakabas route, we need to rescue pappi and her
    > partner from the memory beads as well.we report once again,and
    > Papi protects sumita (the human) from the attack of the warumodan
    > and gets affected herself.

25. > Warumo dan escapes once again. Papis is affected with emotions
    > that she does not want to be disliked by murumo. She escapes to
    > the park. That is how the human sumita came and asked for help.
    > Minigame time: find papi

26. > Correct answer gives 5 points, negative looses 5 seconds, we need
    > 20. You need to select the right pipe like in mario party.
    > Basically RNG so we just mash A and hope that we hit papi 4 times,
    > then we want negative results to shorten the time spend in the
    > game.

27. > We rescue papi with the magic of the fairy bagel, we return to
    > kaedes room to report but instantly murumo and papi get angry at
    > each other. We learn that the warmo dan went to the library , so
    > we unlock this new location and go there right away\!

28. > Yuuki was influenced by memory beads, he lost his dreams and
    > hopes. Rirumo asked to help him, but mirumo said he is fine as he
    > is , so he got punched out of the screen and many books fell into
    > disarray. Next minigame\!

29. > Book catching\! RNG time\! We need to catch 5 books, but its
    > random. If we fail we can get a candy item to skip the minigame
    > (its kind of called a cheat item) but its very useful in
    > blindfolded.

30. > Kaede came to check on them and right as mirumo wanted to heal
    > yuuki, panta (the ghost) came and scared mirumo. He fainted. He is
    > bad with ghosts. He gest woken by a punch and finally is able to
    > restore yuuki\! He is back to normal and calm. This solved the
    > case.

31. > Suddenly Nandakawakannaino appears (slime) which translated mean
    > something “idk what this is” They apparently only appear when the
    > gaia tribe in the gaia forest in the fairy world is angry. So our
    > group goes and checks it out\!

32. > Last branch route here. Gabin is influenced by memory beads. He
    > apparently feels positive, but rirum asks mirumo to remove it. So
    > we help to remove it with the fairy bagel.

33. > We can now enter the cave in the gaia forest\! Minigame\! Avoid
    > osbacles, jump with A,getting hit slows down, dont know timing
    > since blindfolded, we just mash jump. The faster we get to the
    > end, the faster the game is over.

34. > We then head to Fia, she is angry because of the influence. Mirumo
    > tries to heal but gets punched and hindered, so we first need to
    > do this minigame. We need to put the sweet potatoes into the fire,
    > 3 points for a hit and we need 20. Again, random because we cannot
    > know where the flames are. Then we heal Fia\! The slimes
    > nandakawakkannaino disappeared because we helped the fairy world.

35. > But as we leave the cave, dark clouds appear. Saria, mother of
    > mirumo and murumo as wella s the queen is angry = cause. We walk
    > through the village to where peter was. Flower arrangement changed
    > because of storm. Lightning struck when mirumo wanted to protect
    > rurumo. She wants to heal him with magic but she is not good and
    > damaged him even more. Then warumo dan comes to steal the fairy
    > bangle, but mirumo stands up.

36. > Minigame\! Dancing\! If same input as opponent shows = 2 points.
    > In blindfolded random, so just press all the 6 buttons. Easy to
    > fail this game.

37. > But after all they managed to steal the fairy bagel. They try to
    > hit mirumo with the memory beads, but lightning strucks again and
    > they run away. Now we need to go to the fairy castle to resolve
    > the storm. All the way left.

38. > And upon entering the second door in the castle, the character
    > operations aka movement etc. are done for this run. Its basically
    > GG\! Now there will be 5 min of cutscene skips and dialogue
    > mashing.

39. > Both king and queen are influenced by memory beads so we heal
    > them. They feel anxious.strom is gone again and fairy world is
    > peaceful once again. The gatekeeper managed to catch the warumo
    > dan and presents them to the king/queen.they finally get scolded

40. > They confess to have used the last memory beads on kaede so they
    > rush back and heal her. Usually there are always cutscene movies
    > for each.

41. > She cannot wake up because of the strong influence, so they bring
    > Yuuki in order for her to wake up. But it didnt work, so they go
    > to the kumono shop. And ask kumomo. Then the store manager mimomo
    > comes back. He changes to an alternate persona uramimomo. They go
    > back but she still sleeps, then mimomo came as human figure with a
    > dark magic book.and they perform some kind of ritual and still
    > nothing worked. Just when they were to about to give up, the
    > king/queen appear to say that the entire fairy world is praying
    > for her. The warmo group has become a good group the you group.

42. > With the praying power of everyone mirumo tries again, and she
    > finally wakes up\! We did it\! And thats it about the story of
    > this game\! A bit of an unconventional speedrun but really cool,
    > try it out\!
