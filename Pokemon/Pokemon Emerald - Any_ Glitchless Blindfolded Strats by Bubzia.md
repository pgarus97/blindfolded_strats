# Notes

  - > Need to buffer turnarounds, so if facing down and need 2R, then
    > actually 3R as first buffers the direction (only slightly
    > pressed); all directionals include the buffer input

  - > Mash with B if you are facing an NPC after the dialogue to stop
    > cycling

  - > All menus save their last position, so always remember what you
    > did before\!

  - > From bonk into direction : no turnaround frames

  - > Started 11122018 till rival 1, resumed 25042019
