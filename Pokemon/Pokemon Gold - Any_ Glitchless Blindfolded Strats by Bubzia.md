# Notes

  - > Need to buffer turnarounds, so if facing down and need 2R, then
    > actually 3R as first buffers the direction (only slightly
    > pressed); all directionals exclude the buffer input(either buffer
    > it or hold the first step longer for a few frames)

  - > Mash with B if you are facing an NPC after the dialogue to stop
    > cycling

  - > All menus save their last position, so always remember what you
    > did before\! (only on choose)

  - > Pokemon submenus (item, stats) do not memorise\!

  - > Encounters on turnaround frames possible\! Watch out for stepcount
    > and when the encounter starts. //better buffer turnarounds in
    > grass
