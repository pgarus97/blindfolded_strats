# Notes

  - General Fighting: mash B for textboxes so you are back at fighting
    menu without losing track for mashing attacks and random menus

  - MENU resets after fights

  - Keep count how many items you use\! Especially pokeballs and potions
    for menu order until surge

  - Bs dont affect repels\!

<!-- end list -->

  - NuggetBridge and other places: swap out after sandattack causes exp
    loss\! Swapped pokemon needs to die after switching else the run is
    dead

  - Probably save after each major split for safety

  - Started 02092018

  - Repels are gone after SQ Resets

  - Finished 08.10.2018 with a time of 3:14:39
