# Notes

  - > PB after reaching corners for safe corner positions

  - > I personally dont time SFs,DJs and TJs etc. with beats so you need
    > to practice and get a feeling for them

  - > These strats mostly do not contain any diagonal movement since I
    > played on a xbox360 controller, so I cannot PB or even
    > singlehanded do normalized directions.

<!-- end list -->

  - > Start Game with a reset and clear gamefiles

  - > I highly suggest to read strat documents next to an actual run
    > executed, since it gives a better idea of what is meant in the
    > document

  - > Huge shoutouts to zserf and katun24 for helping with these strats
    > and giving ideas/motivation to realize this run

  - > Also huge shoutouts to the Blindfolded Brotherhood in general,
    > love you guys
