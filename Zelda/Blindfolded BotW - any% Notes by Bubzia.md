# Great Plateau% Strats (Excluding Amiibo Farm for any% for own RTA)

## Tower

Cutscene skip after second “reve etoi” instant movement

Z(1L), Uhold run mash A for slate cutscene

Mash till regain control mash 2 B until door opens

Z(1R), ctap, 3sU run into 3sURinto L UL U mash A for slate

Mash till regain control 3 TB into buffer U

Buffer U run till wall climb, then Y to climb up into U UR run for
cutscene

(save)

//from here all beatcounts in 175 bpm

Ctap, 10U,10UL,35L mash A for axe, reZ, sbuffer UL, Z(4L)

(save) //only important save probably

Ctap, U run till Zelda cutscene, buffer UR during it and count 25 from b
cancel, then full U till wall (around 70 beats can save potentially
before)

Drop from wall into ctap, UR R mash A find slate somehow //TODO find
some better normalization for this part

## Bombs

2TB, Skip cutscene skip after first stone sounds, then after slate
update TBx2, mash till control // TODO check how many, timing

Z,Ujump into falldamage cancel with 6.5CD,7CR, talk to old man

Talk option: B,A,A,A ; regain of control after tutorial + 1TB

Sbuffer L into Z(1L), Ctap, U run till wall (90 beats), then run into
wall a few times, 1LJ,1neutral, getup wall into reZtap, sbuffer L into
beatcount 11U then Z(Uhold till wall ,UJclimb +2U,7R,U hold into A mash
for slate)

Skip into U hold A mash for elevator skip

Skip into UL buffered run CD mash

After cutscene( 2tutorial TB), Z(2R), throw bomb + detonate at 3, ctap
into U till wall(5s), L till wall, Rtap into bomb whilste , run R
detonate into L into Rtap,U UR for ladder, climb, reZ(buffered 2U,2R),
sbuffer R into neutral bombthrow with 3 detonate, Z(Uhold when platform
is moving), wait till stop into Z(3U)

Ctap into U till wall, L till wall, Jx2 into fall into U ESS DL hold for
ladder, cancel into Z(buffered3L1D,bomb3throw,buffered3R2D,bomb3throw, U
run for ladder, Z(buffered1L5U4L,1-2L hold for steps, into U run mash A
for monk

Skip

TB, wait for sound of dissolve then skip after 2 s

## Stasis

## Cyro

## Magnesis

# Any % Glitched Route Idea

1.  Get out of first shrine

2.  Get tower (infinite running glitch + grab woodcutters axe for weapon
    throw (only perhaps, might make route to mag and bombs easier (more
    straight?)

3.  Fall damage cancel from tower cutscene to bombs / or climb tower
    TODO time both options

4.  Bombs

5.  Instantly Amiibo equip farming

> We need: (3 set of Fierce Diety)
> 
> Order is important too: revali for bow, then toon zelda for shield (if
> we don’t get the stasis one or somewhere else), then discard all the
> food in the inventory somehow, and then get MM Link farming done.

  - It will be RNG which arrows we will get, best case is lots of bomb
    arrows.

  - We can check how many arrows we dropped by saving, shooting all the
    arrows, counting and then reloading.

<!-- end list -->

6.  Stasis (TODO how to get there fast? Time both from bomb over field
    and from SoR over the hill

7.  Cyro (from stasis to cyro: there is 5 bomb arrow chest from DLC
    potentially)

8.  Magnesis (go from tower)

9.  Flight to ganon castle (BLSS), land with glider into cutscene

10. reset position into leave area for position normalization

11. Ganon Castle Farm (check Saver’s Run notes)

12. Fight (Wolf for specific fight)

13. (check Ganon fight with and without armor; probably both are instant
    death on hit anyways, just +3 attack buff or armor set is gone then)
    //TODO check all 1 hit attacks from ganon + blights , MM link might
    not be the best farm then, but still would probably need some arrows
    from it = maybe ancient arrows?

Movement Guide

  - Normalized Movements: Z target with sidehops all directions

  - Buffering Stick inputs: pausebuffer or neutral jump

  - Camera dynamic to static change: PB D tiny bit into neutral again
    for static camera : TODO is it affected with each load or reload or
    what? =\> definitely after every cutscene

  - Infinite Running Glitch: Dpad D hold into A mash

<!-- end list -->

  - Camera repositioning: PB notches works on like frame1 (probably, at
    least very accurate), Z z-target for facing angle, R3 for current
    camera angle facing

  - You can buffer input / ztarget jumps with swing or neutral hop

  - Climbing Camera Manipulation: climbing resets static back to dynamic
    camera, so each climb needs a tap for sure; Z targeting also resets
    it once more, so we need to tap again after Z targeting: from getup
    we maintain the static cam if tapped before

  - Ztargeting in general resets to dynamic camera : CAREFUL\!

  - Saving: R2 into U AU confirm , you should unequip weapon for saving
    to recognize auto saves

  - Mash text with A hold B mash

Misc Route Stuff

Zelda talking cutscene always after x amount of time or distance

Amiibo usage after first shrine, so after bomb, go amiibo farm?

  - Can remap buttons on switch system menu : for infinite running to
    shoulder button? (remap R (weapon throw with Dpad Down)

  - Big question is order of first two shrines: either mag or bombs, one
    of these we cannot windbomb in that case because amiibo farm will
    start after 1<sup>st</sup> shrine. Otherwise we would need a bow and
    arrows first somehow (Maybe get bow from bokos somehow in front of
    tower; or stasis chest under rock; or mag inside shrine)

  - Picked up armor that you don’t want CANNOT be thrown away besides if
    sold in shop (which is not in the route so RIP)

Amiibo Grind

  - **swiffy22**: iirc, Revali amiibo gives a guaranteed bow before you
    leave Plat, so that's also a good option =\> use this for getting a
    bow ,

  - [botw-tools/amiibo.txt at master · MrCheeze/botw-tools
    (github.com)](https://github.com/MrCheeze/botw-tools/blob/master/amiibo.txt)
    amiibo droplist resource

  - Check if cooked food has higher priority than misc pickups

  - TODO check fierce diety armor how many hits ganon can give you,
    because attack buff is enough to get from food + elixir to last 13
    min
    
      - If the armor is too weak, then we probably need phantom armor
        for hit resistance + attack up =\> no more food needed since
        attack up does not stack.

  - Farm lots of arrows for blight and ganon fight

  - Maybe farm ancient arrows from guardian amiibo

<!-- end list -->

  - 4 Ironshroom + Dragon Fang in castle would be what you're looking
    for and would give 13mins of defense +3 //TODO check if really
    needed with 3 set piece armor

Ganon Fight Information

  - Arrows would be a good and safe source of damage / problem would be
    durability of bows //TODO test maxed out bow inventory =\> how many
    arrows can we shoot?

  - Bomb arrows do lots of damage, would be nice to have a lot from
    amiibo farming

  - Ancient arrows best for ganon fight? TODO check since blights might
    be easier

Saver’s run rewatch

  - pants = boot soud when jumpig

  - wooden shield is probably needed from somewhere for thunderblight
    attack = stasis chest or amiibo

  - cooking guide: <https://www.guideofthewild.com/cook>

  - Ganons Castle Route: need 2 shroom skewers with stamina for royal
    bow and 3 anicent arrows in beginning after bridge,

  - Then get thundersword and enemy ( royal halberd)

  - Ancients arrows behind fake wall normal entrance and enemy lizard
    shield + boomerang

  - After that, destroy barrel = \> acorn? TODO ask Saver

  - Down stairs into statue claymore, savescum into kill for royal
    guards claymore

  - Climb to upper floor for bomb arrows (don’t take bow or other
    weapons?)

  - Shard of naydras fang in hidden chest behind curtains =\> is that
    the elixir or also the defense prolongation buff?

  - Kill lizards in front for more boomerangs and shields

  - Ignore other weapons, throw away thunder sword because farming is
    over ?

  - Then cooking, into ancient arrows on staircase (skip weapon and
    shield?)

  - Climb the tower, kill guarding and use stamina food to do omega
    climb directly to ganons room //TODO figure out somehow without
    stamina shrooms or find amiibo setup for shrooms to skip farming
    (especially hyrule castle ones),

  - //TODO potentially check different entrance for windblight skip or
    at least initial dmg (according to saver windblight is easy though,
    so maybe not worth it)
