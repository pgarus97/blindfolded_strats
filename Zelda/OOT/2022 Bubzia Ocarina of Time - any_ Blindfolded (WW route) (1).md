## Ganon

BIG CUTSCENE D buffer rolls into cutscene

Ganon Phase1: after navi TB :

Quickkill: Buffer shield into Shieldturn R into LR nut, RR LR nut RR, LR
nr BF stick jumpslash, shield RR LR DR restick jumpslash quickkill

From here: CUP (hold Z during it) cancel into 2NR,Z,8RR R hold into
sword

//Backup if no nuts: do normal fight, then backup for sword with holding
U during TB, UR till wall into U renormalize a few times 2LR U hold into
notch then backwalk into sword

Second phase start: slash, BF 6LR and bit of walk into retarget into
jumpslash for first hit, then normal fight (without slow turnaround), 3
slash into UR turnaround retarget repeat for 4 hits (only jumpslash on
1st hit combo)

Important: on first jumpslash we need to hit the head: for that U hold
first then jumpslash with holding, then 2 neutral jumpslashes into U
hold for next hit prep, L hold slash

LastInput: L hold slash after 2-4 steps

Old:mash start to equip kokiri sword, Z,L,L,U,A

Perform shieldcombo: nut into UR slash UR, 180Z, shield Ztarget, hit,
2CUP, shield hit, repeat

Going to Phase2: hold up on clearing zeldas TB, hope that zelda is in
front, you can hear navi, try to just UR and bonk at the end after
2navis, then seath sword and RR, LR DRrollNR backwalk into sword

Phase2: after sword cutscene, DR,8LR,Ztarget into jumpslash for big hit,
then repeat shield combo; though CUP targets are not necessary anymore

Phase3: mash cutscene text till sword glow, Target jumpslash

# Notes

**NutFarm:**2UR, 2RRroll, mash attack for 2 hits, jumpslash into RR,LR
checks , after getting, U reZ and LR position either 1 or 2

//If no item, D into exit, reZ, D into entrance repeat

MENU: stick on CL, just CL, R(nut) on CD, close

Up to navi talk,

No nutfarm to vine = 10s

One nut farm to vine = 26s with good rng

Mido house + shop = 18s + 5s ; 25s total still better then farm

Get zora nuts x2 , if didnt get you can still farm

Now we have 5 nuts: nut farm opportunities x2 so max 15…

Zora x2 nuts +1 stick + 5 rupees = 30s; 10nuts, 15 with shop, 20 with
shop + shop rupee and crawl rupee

CLEAR Test how many hits each phase with nuts, slingshot and sword
jumpslash setup

CLEAR Deku nut (1 chu + rupees lost woods), not needed, ganondorf needs
max 20;10. Possibly for stalfos but also not needed with master sword

seed upgrade (slingshot in lost woods) //not needed, slingshot bad

4 heartpieces child; no just 4 hearts for escape , ganon without getting
hit

kakariko house heartpiece (adult), man on the roof (child), dodongos
cavern top (child), death mountain crater climbwall (child) , ocarina
minigame??? Pls no

Fairy after wrong warp or two bottles, stick gone for ghoma, no problem
actually

Hyrulian shield + 5 hearts work with fairy dupe safety

Phase 1: slingshot 10hits

Dekunuts 10 hits

Just blessRNG for mastersword else repeat

Phase 2: slingshot 18+hit //last hit needs to be sword

Mastersword

Dekunuts nut into sword x10

Stalfos: 5jumpsslash with nuts; 4 each and then finish them off;
mastersword each 2.5hits, so 2 slashes switch

Master sword cutscene fail

Instant deathabuse into mastersword stalfos with 1 potion and OI
